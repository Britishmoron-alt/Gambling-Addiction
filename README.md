# Gambling-Addiction Update V3.4
Games to worsen gambling addictions, play in moderation (JK)
Server hosted with Python and run by a Raspi5 8GB.
No, the server code will NEVER be displayed here
To achieve my main goal here, once it is hosted, it will be a steady source of income, enought to maintain the site and have some extra cash. Therefore, I also plan to add in-game purchases.
Not like, popup type stuff, but an actual shop. 
Prices might be:
60000000 tokens = $2.50?
In other words, if you've got money to spend, you'll probably be on the world leaderboard.
I think I'll also add in "Leagues" of wealth, basically individual leaderboards of top players for each class. For example:
- Richest: world league
- Richer: Major Leagues 1-5
- Rich: Major League 0
- Middle: Minor League 15
- Below Middle: Minor Leagues 0-14
- 0 Dollars: Not on leaderboard.
Those with zero will have to use games/zeroGive.html.

# GAMES:
BJ: Blackjack, (note: have a larger bet or you won't be winning much. in the site, it isn't online yet.)

PacMan Challenge: Play pacman with four lives, win with as many as possible to win a large amount of money. Finally patched it.

D/N: bet all money from all games on one 50-50 chance to double it all

Slots: The first/main game, online. 

# Gamble300C V3.5 Update
Going to add in ads, so I can host on an actual website.
Current link is https://undeniably-preinaugural-demetra.ngrok-free.dev/
Also going to finalize CAH, using user-submitted cards.
So, once I get ads up-and-running, domain will be https://undeniably-preinaug.us/
Might not even need ads, domain is really cheap.
Still, I'll have them for rewards only, so I can still get some cash out of this.
