GAME IDEAS:
Russian Roulette (2 player, win and you get 10x your bet. Lose, and you lose the bet. Minimum bet = 1000.)
Normal Roulette (up to 8 player, same money rules as Russian)
FPS? (most kills gets 100x their bet?)
BlackJack convert to online (currently working on this one)
Poker (hold em, select variant menu?)
Solitaire (win get 5x your bet)
These are mainly minigames, so a few are not really online.
A new update I am thinking about is a game-specific leaderboard, like "oh this guy is better than this guy at ___", for solitaire or something.
